# The Setts

A single-page website for **The Setts**, featuring an interactive slot-machine style logo and links to social and location. 

## Overview

The site displays the “The Setts” custom SVG logo. On load, the letters briefly scramble like a slot machine, then settle into the final spelling. Hovering (or touching on mobile) over any letter makes that letter scramble through random glyphs until the pointer leaves or the touch ends.

## Hosting
The site is hosted using GitHub pages. The DNS is managed at GoDaddy and the site can be found at the following URLs.
